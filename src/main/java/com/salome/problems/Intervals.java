     * Returns a total length covered by intervals.
     * If several intervals intersect, intersection should be counted only once.
     * Example:
     *
     * addInterval(3, 6)
     * addInterval(8, 9)
     * addInterval(1, 5)
     *
     * getTotalCoveredLength() -> 6
     * i.e. [1,5] and [3,6] intersect and give a total covered interval [1,6]
     * [1,6] and [8,9] don't intersect so total covered length is a sum for both intervals, that is 6.
