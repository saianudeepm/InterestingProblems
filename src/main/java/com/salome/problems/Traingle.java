     * Three segments of lengths A, B, C form a triangle iff

     *      A + B > C
     *      B + C > A
     *      A + C > B
     *
     * e.g.
     *  6, 4, 5 can form a triangle
     * 10, 2, 7 can't
     *
     * Given a list of segments lengths algorithm should find at least one triplet of segments that form a triangle (if any).
     *
     * Method should return an array of either:
     * - 3 elements: segments that form a triangle (i.e. satisfy the condition above)
     * - empty array if there are no such segments
